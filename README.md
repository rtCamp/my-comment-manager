## Description ##

This is useful for multi-author blogs where each author can manage comments posted on his/her articles.
S/he can see all comments on one screen to which s/he hasn't replied.

Though it is developed originally for multi-author blog, single-author blog user can also benefit from this as using this plugin will always give you list of unreplied comments on a single screen.

Any comment to which you post a reply, or choose to ignore (see screenshot) will automatically disappear form unreplied comments list.

## Installation ##

1. Download the zip and unzip it.
2. Upload "my-comments-manager" directory into WordPress plugins directory i.e. "wp-content/plugins" (For WPMU: wp-contents/mu-plugins) .
4. Go to "Dashboard >> Plugins" menu and activate "My Comments Manager".
5. You can access My Comments Manager from "Dashboard >> Comments >> My Comments Manager".


That's it ... Have fun!
